I'm a first-year graduate student at the Stanford Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering. Previously, I received a Bachelor of Science with Honors in Applied Mathematics-Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Pure Mathematics from Brown University.

My research interests lie in scientific machine learning, high dimensional statistics, and approximation theory. My current research is in operator learning, advised by [Zhongqiang Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FiMDGpcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [George Em Karniadkis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yZ0-ywkAAAAJ&hl=en).
