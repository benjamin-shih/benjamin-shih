I'm a student studying Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at Brown University. My research interests lie in scientific machine learning, high dimensional statistics, and approximation theory. My current research is in operator learning, advised by [Zhongqiang Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FiMDGpcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [George Em Karniadkis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yZ0-ywkAAAAJ&hl=en). Beginning Fall 2024, I will begin graduate study in computational mathematics at Stanford University in the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering.
